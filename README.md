This board is a small security system emulator for microcontroller practice.  It has a real time clock based memory controller with a removable crystal and battery backup.  Connected to the RTC is a 4 Mb (512 MB) SRAM chip.  With the battery backup, the SRAM becomes NVSRAM so it can then store data.  The other part of the board is an RFID chip that can read and write to a 125 kHz card.  The board is designed to read and write to the ID card and then keep that data, including time and date, in the NVSRAM.  There is also a light on the bottom of the baord for the SRAMs built in ECC.
